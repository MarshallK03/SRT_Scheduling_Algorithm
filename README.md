# Scheduling_Algorithms
This project is an implementation of the Shortest Job First (SJF) and Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) CPU Scheduling algorithms. Both of these 
.py files do not have any dependencies outside of the standard python library, and as such will not need any additional dependencies to run on 
any computer with python configured.
