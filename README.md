# Scheduling_Algorithms
This project is an implementation of the  Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) CPU Scheduling algorithm. The 
.py file does not have any dependencies outside of the standard python library, and as such will not need any additional dependencies to run on 
any computer with python configured.
